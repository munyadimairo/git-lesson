# Notes from Git, GitHub and GitKraken course

Here are the notes I have taken from the [course](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/) 

I have learned how to:

1. create a repository in GitHub and clone it locally 
2. how to _stage_ , _commit_, and _push_ from my **local** repository to the **origin**
3. how to _pull_ from the **origin** to **local**

Next I'm going to publish a WebPage!
